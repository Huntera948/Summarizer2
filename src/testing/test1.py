#text = "LONDON — Global hit records by Harry Styles , Glass Animals and Ed Sheeran , coupled with the popularity of U.K. acts in emerging markets like the Middle East and Africa, helped British music exports climb to a record high of £709 million ($910 million) in 2022, according to new figures released by labels trade body BPI. The London-based organization says 2022’s export tally is the highest annual total since BPI began analyzing labels’ overseas income in 2000. Last year also marked the ninth consecutive year of growth in U.K. music export trade revenues, which slumped to just over £200 million ($254 million at today’s exchange rates) in 2007. BPI, which represents over 500 independent labels, as well as the U.K. arms of Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group, says the consistent year-on-year rise puts the country’s record industry on track to exceed £1 billion ($1.27 billion) in annual music exports by the end of the decade. Driving last year’s 20% growth was a combination of globally successful British artists and the strong value of the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies against the pound sterling. British singer-songwriter Harry Styles’ hit single “As It Was” was the world’s most-streamed song in 2022, according to Luminate data cited by BPI, while Glass Animals’ “Heat Waves” was number two. Other songs by U.K. artists in the year-end global top 10 included Elton John and Dua Lipa’s “Cold Heart (PNAU Remix)” and Ed Sheeran’s “Shivers.” In total, around 450 U.K. artists accumulated more than 100 million global streams last year, up from almost 400 in 2021, BPI reports. That list includes Adele, Arctic Monkeys, Calvin Harris, Coldplay, Dave and Sam Smith, as well as veteran acts The Beatles, Pink Floyd and Queen. Overall, British artists claimed more than a quarter of the 50 most-streamed songs on Spotify in 2022. Worldwide, consumption of British music increased in every region last year, says BPI, with export revenues rising 11% in Europe and up 28% in North America (equivalent trade values were not provided). The fastest-growing regions for U.K. music exports were Africa (up 48%) and the Middle East (up 59%). On a country-by-country basis, all but one of the U.K.’s leading music export markets recorded a rise in export sales, including the U.S. – the leading international market for British acts – where revenues grew 28% to £292 million ($371 million). The second biggest country for U.K. music sales is Germany, where revenues climbed 4% to £58 million ($74 million), followed by France (up 15% to $54 million). In line with the past several years, the U.K.’s share of the global recorded music market remains around 10%, reports BPI, despite the growing international popularity of music acts from Latin America and Asia, particularly South Korea. In a statement, BPI interim chief executive Sophie Jones said the continued success of U.K. labels and artists overseas was “an exceptional achievement in the face of unprecedented competition on the global music stage, both from long-established and rapidly-expanding new music markets.” The U.K. is the world’s third biggest recorded music market behind the U.S. and Japan with sales of just over $1.8 billion in trade value, according to IFPI’s 2022 Global Music Report."

If you\'re dead, you need nothing (any) more.\" The cost of constructing the shelter was around $20,000, the 43-year-old immigration lawyer says -- less than his SUV. \"I can\'t say it\'s a lot for safety, for a calm brain, a calm heart,\" says Barashkov, who lives on a housing estate of low, wooden houses just outside the Ukrainian capital. The door to the bunker stands on Barashkov\'s tree-lined street. His neighbours tend not to talk much, Barashkov says, but he has given them all the code to the shelter. Refuge from attack is available to everyone who can fit inside the bunker -- as many as 15 people. Those around him \"feel better every day when they know that any time, they have a bunker nearby, so it will house them in the case of a huge attack, a nuclear attack\", Barashkov says. Down the 14 steps to the wood-panelled bunker, there are two sofas, a log stove and an as-yet-unused portable toilet -- in case of a lengthy stay downstairs. The longest stint so far has been seven hours, Barashkov says, although he admits he popped up to the surface to smoke a cigarette every so often. Inside, the facility is kitted out with Wi-Fi and a large power bank to charge mobile phones and other devices. Should the electricity be cut, the bunker is equipped with its own diesel generator to keep the lights on. The shelter is a good five metres (16 feet) underground, which the owner says is enough to avoid \"99 percent\" of possible strikes. \"We had a few explosions right here,\" Barashkov says, pulling up a video from a blast outside his home in January. Barashkov says he even comes down to sleep in the bunker, where he finds peace in the dark away from the noise and light pollution at the surface. His attitude contrasts with that of many Kyiv residents, who have stopped seeking shelter during air raids, tired of nights in crowded metro stations or damp cellars. While some of his neighbours are regular visitors, others have not yet opted to make use of the shelter. \"To me, it\'s strange, to be honest,\" he says. \"We should care about children, we should care about women, we should care about ourselves, because we should survive during all this.\" Protecting his family is especially important to Barashkov, whose wife has just given birth to their son. He was \"nervous all the time\" when she was pregnant, and they sheltered in the bunker together. Their son has not yet had to take cover, \"thanks to God\", he says.

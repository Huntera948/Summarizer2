Learn more Forbes Vetted The Best Electric Bikes–Whether You’re Commuting Or Cruising–Based On Rigorous Testing Dave Johnson Forbes Staff Forbes Vetted Contributor Group Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Following Jul 6, 2023, 02:39pm EDT | Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Ready to climb aboard your own electric bike? Thanks to an electric motor, ebikes let you pedal farther, faster and longer than traditional bikes, with models designed for all the usual roles: commuting, off-roading, mountain biking and even schlepping cargo. After extensively testing nine different models, my pick for the best electric bike you can buy today is the Velotric T1 , and it costs a reasonable $1,800. Or you can spend a lot less than that—the Lectric XP 3.0 , my choice for the best value in an electric bike, costs roughly half that. (You can read my in-depth reviews of the Velotric T1 and Lectric XP 3.0 electric bikes for more details, too.) I tested nine electric bikes to find the best ebike for commuting, cruising and beyond. Dave Johnson For Forbes The following is a list of all the ebike winners from my testing process: Best Electric Bike Overall: Velotric T1 Best Electric Sport Bike: LeMond Prolog Best Value Electric Bike: Lectric XP 3.0 Best Electric Utility Bike: Rad Power RadRunner 3 Plus If you’re new to electric bikes, get ready for a little sticker shock. The least expensive ebikes start around $800, and there’s almost no upper limit, with some premium models costing well over $10,000. But you don’t have to spend a fortune to get a great ebike. Remember that at the end of the day, an electric bike is still just a bike. No matter which one you get, you can pedal it normally or engage the motor when you need assistance. Some of the best ebikes, like the LeMond Prolog , are so lightweight and streamlined you can barely tell it’s electric until you feel the “boost” you get while pedaling. Others look more utilitarian, with visible batteries mounted to a sci-fi-style frame. Which bike ends up in your garage depends on your budget and how you intend to use the bike. To help you make a more informed decision, I packed nine bikes into my garage and, over a six-week period, put them through their paces to see which were the best of the best. Read on to see what I loved about each and to choose the right electric bike for your needs. Best Electric Bike Overall Almost Everything You Could Want In A City Bike At A Good Price Velotric Velotric T1 Buy From Velotric Class : 1/3 (20 mph/unlockable to 25 mph, no throttle) | Weight : 36 pounds (330 pound max load) | Range : 70 miles | Motor : 350 watts (600-watt peak) hub | PAS sensor : Torque | Shifter : Shimano 8 speeds | Tires : 27-inch (700-by-38c) puncture resistant | Warranty : 2 years Best for : Easy portability thanks to super light weight Peace of mind with great security features Superb ride and excellent performance Skip if : You must have a throttle You want a digital display without using your phone You need to carry a lot of cargo The Velotric T1 proves that you can have your cake and eat it too, at least when it comes to electric bikes. The T1 packs so much into such an affordable frame—and rides so well—that it was an easy choice to call it the best electric bike overall among the bikes I tested. Let’s start with the fact that the T1 barely looks like an electric bike, which is great for folks who don’t like the modern ebike aesthetic. It weighs just 36 pounds, second only to the 25-pound Lemond Prolog, which makes it light enough to carry around, hoist onto a bike rack or carry up stairs. And the two-tone color scheme is gorgeous. But the real appeal here is that the T1 delivers so much for under $2,000. To turn the bike on, there’s no need to carry a key around like it’s 1987. There’s a fingerprint reader on the top tube that can learn a dozen different fingerprints; place your finger there for a moment and the bike turns on. Alternatively, you can fire it up using the mobile app, which can automatically sense your phone’s proximity and turn on the bike as you approach. The fingerprint reader doubles as a battery indicator and pedal assist level control (which you can also get from the app). On the other hand, that fingerprint reader/control button is the only display on the bike. Unlike other ebikes, the handlebars don’t have a display, so you need to put your phone into the built-in mount on the handlebars to see more details. The T1 lacks a built-in display, which requires you to mount your phone to view important metrics ... [+] via the app. Dave Johnson For Forbes This Class 1 bike can go up to 20 mph right out of the box, though you can easily unlock a top speed of 25 mph, which straddles the definition of a Class 3 ebike. There’s no throttle here, but this bike does have a smooth-as-butter torque sensor that delivers a very enjoyable pedaling experience, something I would expect to find only in a more expensive bike. I rode this bike extensively on flat and hilly terrain, and the 350-watt hub motor was more than up to the task. I loved riding this bike. And speaking of being pleasantly surprised, Velotric includes an eight-speed Shimano shifter and Tektro hydraulic disc brakes. Because I am neurotic about the potential for bike theft, one of my favorite features in the T1 is its GPS tracking: If your bike is moved, you get a theft alert on your phone, and you can locate the bike at any time by tapping the app’s “Find My Bike” button. This feature is included at no additional charge, by the way, so you don’t pay a monthly subscription fee like the one VanMoof charges for a similar bike-tracking service. One way Velotric makes this bike look so streamlined is by building the battery into the downtube. You can’t remove it for charging, so you’ll need an outlet near wherever the bike ends up living when you aren’t riding it. Despite the modest battery size (352.8 watt-hours), Velotric claims a maximum range of about 70 miles. That’s a little optimistic based on my testing, but if you use conservative pedal assistance, I am certain the bike can routinely deliver a range of around 50 miles, and that ain’t bad. This bike has some other charming features as well, like a walking mode that rolls the bike at low speed alongside you when you need to dismount and walk the bike. How awesome is that? Indeed, the Velotric T1 is exactly the bike I’d want to use to commute around town and go riding for fun on the weekends. This combination of features and convenience, aesthetics and awesome ride at a very reasonable price make this the best ebike for most folks. Best Electric Sport Bike A Premium Racing Bike For Commuting Or Recreation LeMond Bicycles, Inc LeMond Prolog Buy From LeMond Bicycles, Inc Class : 1 (20 mph, no throttle) | Weight : 27 pounds (250-pound max load) | Range : 70 miles | Motor : 250-watt hub | PAS sensor : Cadence | Shifter : Shimano 11 speeds | Tires : 27.5-by-1.5-inch | Warranty : Limited lifetime Best for : Cyclists with the cash for a luxury, high performance ebike that looks the part Riding on a featherweight bike you can carry with one hand Paved roads and bike paths Skip if : You need to haul a lot of cargo Security and theft is a major worry Even if you’re not a road-racing fan, you know Greg LeMond, the three-time Tour de France winner who is probably the most well-known American cyclist (Lance Armstrong notwithstanding). LeMond has his own bike brand, and the LeMond Prolog is its flagship ebike. Let’s get this out of the way right up front: The Prolog is a $5,500 bike, and that’s if you don’t upgrade to the electronic shifter, which is another $800. With so many other, more affordable bikes on the market, you may be wondering why anyone would spend that much money for an ebike. Simply put, because it’s a work of art, in motion and at rest. The bike is visually stunning with its clean, aerodynamic lines and not the slightest indication it’s an electric bike without close inspection. The aesthetics are absolutely impeccable. And when you climb aboard? I have never had so much fun on an ebike. Weighing in at just 27 pounds, it’s lighter than my traditional non-electric bike, and that means it flies like the wind, easily accelerating from a cold stop whether or not the electric motor is engaged. It handles like a dream, and if I had $5,500 to spend on an electric bike, I would spend it on the Prolog without hesitation. The Prolog's slender, refined frame helps it look like a traditional road bike. Dave Johnson For Forbes You’re not paying for a lot of “smart” features with the Prolog. Yes, you can connect to the bike via a mobile app that gives you control over the pedal assist and a detailed dashboard while you’re riding (though you’ll need to buy your own phone mount). Instead, most of that money is going into the paperweight carbon fiber frame and the breathtaking styling, along with a Shimano 11-speed GRX shifter and other deluxe components, like the Shimano BL-RS600 hydraulic disc brake lever. The front and rear lights are elegantly integrated into the frame, and a single button on the top tube turns on the bike and controls the pedal assist (if you choose to keep your phone in your pocket). You also get a limited lifetime warranty on the frame and wheels (and two years on the LeMond components)—something almost unheard of in a world of ebikes, where you tend to get just one or two years of protection. You might be tempted to think the Prolog is just a sport bike, but you can easily use it for day-to-day city bike duties. Options include adding a rack, basket and range-extending battery, if you want more than the maximum of 70 miles that LeMond claims (based on my testing, it’s closer to 55 miles in real-world conditions). And don’t worry that the 250-watt Mahle rear hub motor won’t be able to deliver the goods. This bike handled all the terrain I tested the other bikes on, and easily scaled the steep overpass that I cannot pedal on leg power alone. Not everyone has $5,500 to spend on an ebike, so for many folks (myself included) this is an aspirational choice. But therein lies a serious problem: Whether or not you consider this affordable, a bike that costs this much money should have some built-in security—GPS tracking, a hub lock or even a lockout that prevents the bike from turning on without the app. I’d be wary of leaving a bike this precious around town without a beefy chain and lock. But that aside, if you have the money to invest in the LeMond Prolog, you will not be disappointed. Best Value Electric Bike A Powerful And Versatile Folding Bike For A Ridiculously Low Price Lectric eBikes Lectric XP 3.0 Buy From Lectric eBikes Class : 2/3 (28 mph, throttle) | Weight : 64 pounds (330 pound max load) | Range : 65 miles | Motor : 500 watts (1,000-watt peak) hub | PAS sensor : Cadence (with wattage regulation) | Shifter : 7 speeds | Tires : 20-by-3-inch fat puncture resistant | Warranty : 1 year Best for : Riders on a budget Folks who don’t want to assemble their new ebike Hauling groceries, pets and passengers Skip if : You’re looking for a bike that’s more conventionally attractive A lighter bike you can lift onto a bike rack It’s hard to find a quality electric bike for much under $1,000—it just isn’t practical to make an ebike for much less. According to Leo Raudys, CEO of Call2Recycle, the first industry-wide ebike battery recycling program in the U.S., \"If the battery itself costs perhaps $600, and the entire bike is only a little bit higher than that, then you have to ask questions like, \‘How good are the components? How good do I feel about the engineering? Is it going to hold up over time?’ It gets pretty difficult to do that at that price.\" Nonetheless, a handful of quality ebikes are available in this price range. Lectric’s XP 3.0 might be among the cheapest bikes you can buy, but it’s so thoughtfully designed that it’s a genuinely good choice for first-time ebike buyers and city riders on a budget. You are not settling for some sort of cut-rate consolation prize with this bike. The Lectric XP 3.0 is powered by a 1,000-watt rear hub motor with a 500-watt-hour battery that can get you up to 65 miles on a single charge (in my testing, I’d say you could expect closer to 45 miles in real-world riding conditions). It’s a Class 3 bike that tops out at 28 mph on pedal assist and 20 mph with the twist throttle. The Lectric XP 3.0 has integrated lights, fenders, 3-inch fat tires and—surprisingly—a hydraulic suspension. And recently, Lectric started including hydraulic brakes at no additional cost. That’s a substantial upgrade from the mechanical brakes that Lectric used to build into this model, and it makes this one of the few ebikes under $1,000 to offer this feature. The Lectric XP 3.0 folds away when it's not in use, saving valuable space in a garage or shed. Dave Johnson For Forbes Of course, I buried the lede: This is a foldable bike, collapsing to about half its normal size, thanks to a locking hinge in the middle of the frame. Unfortunately, I feel like I’m fighting a fat octopus every time I fold it. After all, this bike weighs a hefty 64 pounds, and you need to be careful when you handle it lest you end up with a pinched finger. But the fact that it folds makes it easy to throw in the back of a minivan or store in the corner of the garage. One of the things I love most about the XP 3.0 is its wide array of accessories. This is a utility bike, after all, and you can add a cargo package with racks and baskets, or get a pet trailer that hitches to the back. Speaking of passengers, you can also add a passenger seat for a second rider as well. Of course, no $1,000 bike is going to be perfect. The small 20-inch wheels means the ride is bumpier than what you’d get from a bigger tire, and not everyone will love its aesthetics. But the stuff you do get is compelling. The black-and-white digital display is big, easy to read and tells you everything you need to know to have a great ride. The price is the major selling point, however, and after riding this bike a lot , it seems to me that Lectric has made the right choices to balance cost against performance. Best Electric Utility Bike Limitless Accessories Make This Great For Passengers, Pets And Cargo Rad Power Bikes Rad Power RadRunner 3 Plus Buy From Rad Power Bikes Class : 2 (20 mph, throttle) | Weight : 75.5 pounds (350-pound max load) | Range : 45 miles | Motor : 750-watt hub | PAS sensor : Cadence | Shifter : Shimano 7 speeds | Tires : 20-by-3.3-inch fat | Warranty : 1 year Best for : Cyclists who want to haul cargo Customizing your bike with accessories, including a passenger seat Combining comfort, power and utility in one frame Skip if : A 75-pound frame is simply too heavy for you You’re looking for a folding bike You want a more modern ebike aesthetic or smartphone connectivity Rad Power’s RadRunner 3 Plus isn’t going to win any beauty awards; it’s utilitarian through and through, with a heavy, angular frame that sits on squat 20-by-3.3-inch fat tires. But all that practicality shapes the RadRunner 3 Plus into the best utility ebike on the market. This Class 2 bike can power its way up to 20 mph using either pedal assist or the twist throttle. The smaller tires are very grippy, making them awesome for almost any sort of road or trail condition, and the ride is smoother than I expected, thanks to the suspension in the front fork. The beefy 750-watt hub motor gave me a thoroughly authoritative ride; it aggressively raced up a steep incline that taxed many other ebikes during ride tests. That said, it sometimes feels a little jerky in operation, but that’s going to be true of any bike with a cadence sensor: The pedal assist is either on or off, and it takes a pedal rotation or two to engage the motor. But I was really impressed with the components in the RadRunner, including a seven-speed Shimano shifter and Tektro hydraulic brakes. Despite this bike’s formidable weight (more on that later), I was able to bring it to a stop very quickly. This is a general purpose ebike; you can use it to commute around town or go for weekend joyrides, and I used it for both. But the RadRunner 3 Plus was born to be a utility bike, and Rad Power gives you a lot of options to configure the design based on your needs. Need to carry cargo? There’s a locking hardshell console you can mount between your legs, for example, which I found handy for stowing personal items. You can add front and rear baskets, a tow-behind trailer and even a passenger seat. I also loved the controls and display. Rad Power includes two consoles on the handlebars; the power unit on the left prominently reports the level of pedal assistance, while another display shows your speed and other details. That’s all you get, though; there is no mobile app to sync with here. The RadRunner's utilitarian design was well-suited for errands and adventures. Dave Johnson For Forbes The lack of mobile phone connectivity is just one way this bike feels a tad old school. It’s the heaviest bike I tested by far, clocking in at over 75 pounds. It was almost impossible for me to hoist it onto my car’s trailer hitch bike rack by myself, but I managed to pull it off. The battery isn’t hidden in the downtube but is semi-integrated into the frame, removable with a key (when you first get started, you might think the key locks the bike, but don’t be fooled). It also was among the least-assembled bikes to arrive at my doorstep. If you’re somewhat mechanically inclined, you should be able to put it together yourself. If, however, you open the box and it looks like a random collection of pinball machine parts, you might want to drive it to a local bike shop for assembly. That is what I did, despite videos online to help you assemble it. The battery also has its own display for charge status, which I really appreciated, and I managed to get about 40 miles on a single charge. Your mileage may vary depending on terrain and how much you lean on the motor to get around. You’d be hard pressed to find a better utility ebike than the Rad Power’s RadRunner 3 Plus—I couldn’t. And while it’s easy to focus on the specs and features, the most telling compliment I can give this bike is that, when riding home with a basketful of groceries, I couldn’t help but think about how comfortable it was to ride the RadRunner 3 Plus. MORE FROM FORBES VETTED The Best Folding Chairs That Allow You To Sit Just About Anywhere By Camryn Rabideau Contributor The Best Alarm Clocks To Create A More Peaceful Sleep Routine By Rebecca R. Norris Contributor Other Electric Bikes I Tested VanMoof S4 ($2648) : The VanMoof S4 is quite impressive and something of a runner-up to the best overall ebike, the Velotric T1. It’s packed with exciting tech, like a superb integrated security system. Kick a button at the rear to immobilize the bike with a hub lock, for example, and the only way for a thief to make off with your 45-pound bike is to carry it away, because the rear wheel won’t roll. (And an alarm sounds the whole time, should anyone try to move it.) There’s a lot more to love here, like the tech-sexy tubular design in four eye-catching colors, integrated lighting and a 14-day, no-hassle return policy if you don’t love your purchase. But the ride itself is underwhelming; you have to use the VanMoof app on your phone to change pedal assist levels because the button on the bike itself only triggers the throttle-like turbo boost mode. And after coasting, you often have to pedal a few full revolutions before the gears engage, which is disconcerting and uncomfortable. VanMoof does a lot of things right, but still gets enough things wrong that other brands (like Velotric) have taken the lead. Gazelle Ultimate C380 HMB ($4749) : I genuinely love the Gazelle Ultimate C380 HMB. This beefy step-through bike from an iconic Dutch bike-maker features a superb Enviolo 380 Trekking Manual stepless gear system that means you can shift continuously from the lowest gear to the highest just by twisting a collar on the handlebar. It’s also low maintenance and uses a high-tech carbon belt drive, so no greasy chains or cluster of gears like a traditional bike. The Class 3 bike can go up to 28 mph with four levels of pedal assist (sorry, no throttle), has a formidable 65-mile range and easy-to-read digital display on the handlebars. For security, the bike includes a key-operated hub lock, so thieves can’t roll the bike away—they’d need to carry the 56-pound behemoth to their truck. It has cool extras as well, like a battery that can be easily removed for indoor charging and a suspension in the fork to smooth out the ride. Gazelle offers an incredibly generous warranty: 10 years on the frame, five years on the fork and two years on the motor and other electrical components. I’d love to give Gazelle’s impressive beast an award, but it’s a bit pricey, heavy enough to be inconvenient (good luck lifting it onto your car’s bike rack) and isn’t available direct to consumer (you have to visit a Gazelle dealer bike shop). Ride1Up Prodigy ($2295) : Ride1Up has a reputation for offering a little bit more than you’d expect to find in whatever bike they’re selling at a given price point, and the Ride1Up Prodigy is a great example. This $2,300 ebike is built around the German-made Brose TF Sprinter motor, an upscale Shimano Alivio derailleur with nine-speed shifter and super-grippy Tektro HD-M275 dual-piston hydraulic brakes with 180-mm disc rotors. Bike connoisseurs who know their components would expect this bike to cost a few hundred more than it does. It rides well, thanks to the torque sensor that gently increases the motor’s power the harder you pedal. Even so, it’s a bit heavy at 50 pounds and has no connected, smart or integrated security features. Frustratingly, the bike suffered from a debilitating electrical issue that persisted even after Ride1Up performed a repair to resolve the issue. Cannondale Adventure Neo Allroad ($1825) : The Cannondale Adventure Neo Allroad is a solid and fun all-around adventure bike, but in a lot of ways, it feels like a step down from Ride1Up’s Prodigy. It’s similarly heavy, which can make it hard to move around, but it lacks the Prodigy’s Shimano shifter. Even so, it has all the basics covered: a seven-speed shifter, Tektro hydraulic brakes, a 250-watt hub motor and Kenda tires and an optional front suspension for a smoother ride (the model I tested was equipped with the suspension). Expect to get as much as 45 miles per charge, and the battery is removable so you can bring it indoors to charge. There’s no question that this Cannondale is a solid choice, but given the price, I feel like it doesn’t compete well with similar models from other brands that add a torque sensor, app connectivity, a more deluxe shifter and better cargo options. Gocycle G4i ($5499) : While the Lectric XP 3.0, my choice for the best budget ebike, is also a folding bike, I felt like it folds because it has to, not because it wants to. The Gocycle G4i, on the other hand, is eager to please. This 37.7-pound bike is light enough to carry around with one hand, which makes the easy-fold mechanism worthwhile; you can bring this on the subway without much trouble—and that’s just scratching the surface. The G4i is a great bike, albeit a luxury one at $5,500. It certainly looks distinctive, with tiny (but fat) 20-inch tires on a squat frame that is reminiscent of something you might see at a circus. Aesthetically, it’s an acquired taste, but it’s packed with innovation. The fork-shaped kickstand is ultra-secure, but annoyingly you can only deploy it from one side of the bike. To simplify the riding experience, the bike is built around a Shimano Nexus three-speed predictive electronic shifter that, as the name suggests, switches gears automatically depending on riding conditions. The torque sensor adjusts power to the wheels based on how hard you pedal, but the only way to change power levels is via the mobile app (it also has a throttle that lets you accelerate while coasting). And the mobile app is a convoluted mess, which complements the unintuitive light pattern on the handlebar that tells you battery levels and other data if you’re not using the app. If Gocycle learns from what doesn’t quite work here, though, its next iteration just might be amazing. How I Tested The Best Electric Bikes When selecting the products for this roundup, it was important to include the most popular and common ebikes on the market—the ones that Forbes Vetted readers are most likely to consider. I included both direct-to-consumer ebikes (from online, mail-order brands) and models that you need to visit dealerships to purchase. I assembled a cross-section of bikes in styles most people want to ride, like commuter and city bikes, folding bikes, off-road bikes and utility bikes that can carry cargo. Assembly Once all the bikes were on hand, I evaluated how easy they were to assemble. Some come fully assembled, while most are partially built and can be finished with some simple tools in less than an hour. A handful of bikes required substantial assembly; if you’re not already a confident bike mechanic, you’ll want to factor another $100 into the price to have a local bike shop assemble it for you. The bottom line is that I noted the overall difficulty (and potential expense) of the initial out-of-box experience. Some ebikes were assembled at the local bike shop while others I had to assemble on my own. Dave Johnson For Forbes Ride Experience Then it was time to hit the road. I took every bike on a handful of 10-mile treks across city streets, onto dirt and grassy paths and on a paved bike path that cuts across a substantial part of the state of Michigan. I noted each bike’s comfort, handling, shifting and braking. In other words: How well did it work as an actual bike? Power And Range As with any electric vehicle, it’s important to understand how much power the motor delivers and what kind of range you can expect to get. To assess how well the motor could power the bike, I paid attention to pedal assist and throttle response on level ground as well as on a particularly steep overpass that I am physically unable to scale on a traditional bike with leg power alone. I also tracked real-world range, although this can vary enormously depending on a wide variety of factors. Smart And Security Features I love so-called smart features, and I explored whatever each bike offered, like integrated displays, electronic shifting and high-tech security. Some bikes had few or none of these capabilities, while others were veritable props from a science-fiction story. I assessed how easy these features were to use and whether they were practical or useful. Bikes with integrated anti-theft or security features tended to score better. How To Shop For An Electric Bike When you shop for a bike, start with how you expect to use the bike most often. There are a lot of different bike styles, and some tend to overlap, but here are the most common ebikes you’ll encounter: Commuter and city bikes . These are everyday bikes you use to get around town on paved roads, but some are also “hybrid” bikes that can handle off-roading as well. Fat tire bikes . You know you’re looking at a fat tire bike when the tires are a couple of inches wide. All that surface area adds up to a lot of traction, which is great for riding on sand, snow and soft off-road surfaces. Utility bikes . These don’t look that sexy, but they let you bolt on baskets in front or back, drag a cargo trailer and sometimes even add a passenger seat. These are workhorse bikes you can use to go grocery shopping or make Grubhub deliveries. In fact, cargo bikes are a subset of the utility bike category. Mountain bikes . Designed for intense off-road adventures, a good mountain bike has wide tires and a beefy suspension system to let you go up and down steep and rugged terrain. Mountain bikes that only have front suspensions are often called hardtails. Sport bikes . Also known as performance bikes, these follow in the footsteps of racing bikes. They’re light, have paper-thin tires, and let you go fast with manual pedal power, with or without electric assistance. Once you know what kind of bike you want, that should narrow down the field so you can look for something in your price range. See “How Much Should I Pay For A Good Electric Bike?” below for some thoughts on price ranges. A closer look at the RadRunner 3 Plus' pedal assist system (PAS). Dave Johnson For Forbes When it comes to features, there are other considerations. Here are some features you might want to look for: Folding bikes . Some models can be folded in seconds to be thrown into the back of your car, carried onto mass transit or stowed near your desk at work. Attachment points . Many bikes—especially utility bikes, but also many commuter bikes—let you bolt on storage racks and baskets, a passenger seat and more. Fenders . Weirdly, not all ebikes come with fenders, but these come in handy to shield you from splashing dirt, mud and water while riding. Especially if you plan to commute to work on an ebike, it’s worth investing in a model with fenders. Security . Bikes get stolen. A lot. So while you should always lock your bike when you step away, I love when security comes integrated with many modern ebikes. Look for features like GPS tracking and hub locks. The technical specifications are also important. Not a bike mechanic? No problem—here are some things to keep an eye on: Ebikes are easier to ride when they include both multiple levels of pedal assistance (PAS) and a mechanical or electronic shifter. Single-gear ebikes that rely just on PAS can be awkward to handle when the terrain isn’t level. Look for name brand components. Is the shifter designed in-house by the bike brand? It’s probably fine, but a Shimano shifter is probably going to work more smoothly and last longer. Get hydraulic brakes. Ebikes are heavier than traditional bikes and can go a fair bit faster, so you want a lot of stopping power. Avoid mechanical brakes (more common in very inexpensive ebikes). If you’re a nerd, look for ebikes that work with an app. Some ebikes sync with a mobile app that lets you customize the bike’s performance in detail, as well as see your speed and PAS on a big beautiful screen when riding. Bonus points for apps that track your cycling stats and workout. My Expertise I have been a technology journalist since the 1990s. I chose this career in large part because I enjoy playing with all sorts of gadgets, gear and technology. As I racked up countless writing credits at publications as diverse as Forbes, PC World, Digital Camera Magazine, CNET, TechHive and Insider (not to mention authoring nearly three dozen books), I got to test and use a ton of gear along the way. I managed to mix all that with my love of biking. I was an early adopter of electric bikes, writing about and reviewing them from their earliest days on the market while using them to get around town and go on long weekend recreational treks. I’ve managed to stay abreast of the latest developments in electric biking as I tested and reviewed numerous models over the last decade. When I started preparing to test bikes for this article, I already had a small collection of ebikes in my garage (almost to the point that I couldn’t fit my car). To help me navigate the ebike universe, though, I leaned on the expertise of a handful of unabashed experts in the field. I spoke to Alyssa Mcadam, head mechanic for ebike reseller Upway , and Leo Raudys, CEO of Call2Recycle , which operates the first industry-wide ebike battery recycling program in the U.S. I also got insights from Ash Lovell, Ph.D., the electric bicycle policy & campaign director at PeopleForBikes , and Levi Conlow, the CEO of Lectric Bikes . What Is An Electric Bike? An electric bike—also known as an ebike—is much like a traditional bike, with the addition of a battery and electric motor that can be used to help turn the wheels, adding to the power the rider generates through the pedals. You can generally choose how much power the motor provides at any given time, so you can rely entirely on pedal power, a mix of both motor and pedals or mostly motor power. Who Are Electric Bikes For? In a word, everyone. According to Lovell, ebike versions are available for every kind of traditional bike, “whether it's a cruiser or a commuter or a mountain bike. And what we've seen with ebikes is that they make riding much more fun. Because of that, people do it more often.” Are Ebikes Safe? Yes. Electric bikes can go faster than traditional bikes, but that can be a good thing, especially when navigating city streets with automobiles. Mcadam says \“you can be more comfortable with cars around you because you have more speed.” As long as you wear a helmet , obey traffic laws and stay aware of your surroundings, ebikes are as safe as traditional bikes. But like any electric vehicle, you may have some concerns about battery safety. Lovell suggests that if you are concerned about battery safety, you can look for or ask the manufacturer about its certification standards. “There are two big ones that you can look for, either UL 2849 or EN15194. EN15194 is the European standard, and that's what the majority of the bicycle industry is already certified for.\” Do All Electric Bikes Have A Throttle? No, a throttle is not mandatory for ebikes—it depends on what class the bike belongs to. Class 2 ebikes and some Class 3 ebikes have a throttle that you can use to accelerate without pedaling at all. Class 1 ebikes do not have a throttle. The real question, though, is whether you need a throttle. A throttle can be helpful, especially if you ride on steep or hilly terrain. A throttle can also be convenient if you want to recover from hard pedaling and let the bike do all the work. But consider a throttle a convenience that most riders can easily do without.
